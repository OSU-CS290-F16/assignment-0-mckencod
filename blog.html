				I had trouble with rotating my picture to be the way it should, I could not find a way to fix this through just HTML and even tried re-adding the picture so I guess I will have to accept the sideways picture.  I did not learn anything really from this assignment other than how to use git and github, I already had all the knowledge for HTML, it was just basically a refresher for me.  W3chools helped me out quite a bit in accomplishing the things I wanted to get done in certain ways.
