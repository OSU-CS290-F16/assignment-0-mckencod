				<li>I plan to major in Computer Science by December of 2019.</li>
				<li>I would say I am at about 7 for my comfortability zone.</li>
				<li>I am hoping to learn a few more coding languages and to get better at the ones I already know.</li>
				<li>I have indeed signed up for Piazza.</li>
				<li>The most interesting thing to have happened to me would have to be when I crashed when snowboarding and somehow got my head stuck in a crater of snow.</li>
